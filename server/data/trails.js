    description: "Located south of Lake Placid, this fantastic hike leads to two of the famous 46 Adirondack High Peaks, Cascade and Porter Mountains. The trailhead is located just west of Cascade Lakes off Route 73, which is often thought of as one of the most scenic roads in the country.\n\nYou’ll set out from the parking lot along the Cascade Mountain Trail, which begins with a set of stairs entering the woods. You’ll cross a small creek and begin ascending more quickly. After a little over 2 miles, you reach the trail junction for the summit of Cascade and Porter. Cascade Peak is more exposed than the summit of Porter, and does involve some minor rock scrambling to reach the top. There is also a restroom located near the top.\n\nBoth summits have great views, but Cascade is known for its incredible 360-degree views of the High Peaks Region and Adirondack Mountains. Trails in the area can become very muddy and slippery during the rainy season so take caution when scrambling over rocky sections of trail. This route is also a popular winter excursion, just keep an eye on the weather as conditions get very windy as you climb higher into the Adirondacks.\n\nBecause this is considered one of the easier 46ers to summit and its close proximity to Lake Placid, this is one of the most popular day hikes in the Adirondacks. It is highly recommended to arrive early to ensure a parking spot."

Be sure to stop at the overlook on the way down for a final view of the Hudson River!"

There are old hotel ruins, a fire tower, a plane crash (if you know where to look), and extraordinary views. \n\nThe Overlook Mountain House ruins are the most popular reason why many hikers come to explore.  The mountain fire tower hosts nice views of the Catskills and even the Hudson Valley. \n\nThe path is wide and clear- easy to stay distanced from others. There are no switchbacks or other forest trails. It is not the most technical trail in the area, needless to say.\n\nBring some lunch up at the top because there are a few picnic tables where you can eat. You can go up the stairs in the tower, but it may be locked depending on the day. Users report getting to the parking lot early for a spot."
